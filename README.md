# A Project by Syed Ukkashah & Ibrahim Johar [2024]

# ABSTRACT
The project aims to design and implement a 2-D Space Shooter [GALACTICVERSE] where the player controlles spacecraft is supposed to shoot through enemy space craft and collect points while avoiding collision with enemy space craft
and keeping the health intact. 

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project uses SFML concepts and OOP concepts to make the game have attributes like:
1. Sprites and textures to add a 2-D graphical interface to the project
2. Randomly generated enemy sprites that get destroyed when player bullets come into contact with them.
3. Sound effects and UI interfaces which includes text and a space background
4. Keeping track of attributes like player score, enemy health, player health as well as timers and clocks etc.

# REFERENCES
